Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object?
If so, how? If not, why not?

Answer:
Not sure whether I understand the question or not.
Can one determine whether p points to a valid object using code/compiler?
No, not really.
Can one determine whether p points to a valid object using logic?
Yes.

A pointer is valid whenever it's initialized. It's that simple.
It can point to any object or, can even be a nullptr.
If one uses an uninitialized pointer, as with an undefined variable,
then one is simply waiting for a run-time error to take place.
If we have an uninitialized pointer within our code, do we even have
need for that pointer?
