Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do.

int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;

a) r2 = 3.14159;
b) r2 = r1;
c) i = r2;
d) r1 = d;

b) & d) are invalid. Since they are attempting to reassign the references.

a) reassigns d to 3.14159
c) reassigns i to d, which would still be 0, unless one executes a) first. In which case, i would be
   reassigned to 3.14159
