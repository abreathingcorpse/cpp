What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values are all equal?
What if there are no duplicated values?

If all values are equal, the program would print:
x occurs n times, where is the value of the integer being given and n is the amount of times said
integer is given.

If there are no duplicated values then, the program would print:
"x occurs 1 times" n amount of times. That is, x is the current integer being printed so it'll be
printed n amount of times with different xs.
