Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain what's wrong and how to
correct it.

a) std::cin >> int input_value;
b) int i = { 3.14 };
c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
d) int i = 3.14;

a) I believe that, as long as one inputs digits only, the input will be stored on the
   int input_value. However, I'm not sure what happens exactly if one attempts to write
   two ints or starts trying to type characters along with those digits. If what the user types
   is a type float number, then it'll simply be truncated into an int.

b) This definition is illegal, since it's a Definition with Curly Braces. One may fix it by either
   making the number inside the bracers into an int, or instead of making i an int make it into
   any of the floating types.

c) Since salary is equal to wage but, wage hasn't been defined yet. I don't this this will fly.
   For this to work, wage should be defined before the salary and then the salary may be assigned to
   wage.

d ) i will simply be truncated, in other words, i = 3;

After validating:

a) One must declare the variable input_value, before attempting to
   input into is using std::cin. Afterwards, it simply stores the first integer.
   If one inputs a character then it's stored as 0.
