What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?

std::string global_str;
int global_int;

int main()
{
	int local_int;
	std::string local_str;
}


Answer:
global_str = \0 [null character]
global_int = 0
local_int & local_str are undefined since they are inside a function, which in this case happens to
be the main function.
