What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?

std::string global_str;
int global_int;

int main()
{
	int local_int;
	std::string local_str;
}


Answer:
global_str = \0 [null character]
global_int = 0
local_int & local_str are undefined since they are inside a function, which in this case happens to
be the main function.

After revisiting the book:
It's up to each class whether we can define objects of that type without an initializer.
If we can, the class must determine their default values. The library string class, particularly,
uses the empty string (null char).
Threfore, local_str is defined as the null character as well.
