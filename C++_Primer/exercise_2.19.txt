Explain the key differences betweent the pointers and references.
Pointers are objects, whereas references are not. Therefore the
pointers have a memory address, while the references do not. Which
is why a pointer can not point to a reference.

Furtheremore, since pointers are objects, they do not require to be
initialized upon definition, which is not the case for the references.
Additionally, the pointers may be updated. That is, they can point to
another memory address later inside the code, whereas references can not.
This is also due to the fact that pointers are objects.

After revisiting the book:
Pointers can be assigned and copied.
