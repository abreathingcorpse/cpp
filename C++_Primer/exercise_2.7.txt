What values do these literals represent? What type does each have?

a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"
b) 3.14e1L
c) 1024f
d) 3.14L

Given the following octal values:

\145 = e
\012 = \n

Then a) is a string literal type with the value: "Who goes with Fergus?\n"
Remember: string literals begin with the null character \0

b) 31.4 - long double
c) 1024.0 - float type
d) 3.14 long double

While validating my answer, I encountered that c) is not a valid literal.
It's an integer type literal with a floating-point suffix.
This could be solved by declaring it as either:
1024.f - writing the point
1024l - using an actual Integer literal suffix
