What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:

int month = 9, day = 7;
int month = 09, day = 07;

The first line has decimal integers, while the second line has octal integers.

By writing this program, I've encountered that the value of 09 is not a valid octal digit.
Octal digits must have 3 integers, instead of 2.
