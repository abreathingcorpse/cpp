Assuming p is a pointer to int, explain the following code:

if (p) // ...
if (*p) // ...

Answer:
Since this exercise assumes that p is a pointer to int, then it can
not be a nullptr. Therefore the first if will always return true.
Since the integer to which p points to must be defined & initialized
already.

Regarding the second if, this will return true as long as the integer
to which p points to is not 0.
