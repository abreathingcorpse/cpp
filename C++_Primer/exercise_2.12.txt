Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?

a) int double = 3.14;
b) int _;
c) int catch-22;
d) int 1_or_2 = 1;
e) double Double = 3.14;

I think that both c) & d) are invalid definitions/declarations.
I seem to recall that one may not use "-" on the variable names and that one may not start a
variable name with a number, most likely, because the compiler will attempt to use the variable
name as a literal in that case.

After revisiting the book:
Identifiers must begin with either a letter or an underscore.
Identifiers may not contain two consecutive underscores, nor can they begin in an underscore
following by a capital letter. Additionally, identifiers defined outside a function may not begin
with an underscore.

Therefore b) would also be invalid if it's defined outside of any function.

After validating:
I never realized that a) was an int double. double is a C++ keyword, which would result in an error.
I was right with the c) & d) ones.
However, it looks like b) can be defined even outside of the main function. Which is a, well,
function.
