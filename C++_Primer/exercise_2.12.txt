Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?

a) int double = 3.14;
b) int _;
c) int catch-22;
d) int 1_or_2 = 1;
e) double Double = 3.14;

I think that both c) & d) are invalid definitions/declarations.
I seem to recall that one may not use "-" on the variable names and that one may not start a
variable name with a number, most likely, because the compiler will attempt to use the variable
name as a literal in that case.
