Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a definition:
a) extern int ix = 1024;
b) int iy;
c) extern int iz;

Answer:
a) is a definition, because when one initializes a declaration, it turns into a definition.
b) is a definition, memory is being allocated since we are not using the extern keyword.
c) since we are using the extern keyword then iz is only being declared.
   The variable can be used by other programs but it'll need to be defined elsewhere.
   Remember that the variable can only be defined once.
