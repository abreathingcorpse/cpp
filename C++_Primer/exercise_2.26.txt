Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal,
explain why.

a) const int buf;
b) int cnt = 0;
c) const int sz = cnt;
d) ++cnt; ++sz;

Answer:
legal: b) & c)
illegal: a) & d)

a) is not initialized. Constant objects need to be initialized. If
an object is constant, then it can not change. If one has an
uninitialized constant object, then does one would actually need
that object?

d) sz is a constant variable, therefore it can't be updated. It's
an error to attempt to do so.
