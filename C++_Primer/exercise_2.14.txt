Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed?

int i = 100, sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
	sum += i;
std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;

Answer:
Assuming that the lines inside the above program go inside of the main function, then yes, it should
be legal.

Since the print takes place outside of the for, then it'd only be called once. It'd exit whenever
i = 10. But, that'd be i within the for loop. Outside of the for loop, i = 100, which is the value
that would be printed.
sum would be the sum from 0 to 9. Which would be 45.
