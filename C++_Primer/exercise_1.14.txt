Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a while. Are there advantages
or disadvantages to using either form?

Not sure if an advantage of disadvantage but, the only difference that I can see is that one
needs to declare the val/i (or however you'd like to call it) index outside the scope of the while.
Meanwhile, the index only exists within the scope of the for loop.
So, if one requires the index value after the loop has ended, then one must use a while loop.
