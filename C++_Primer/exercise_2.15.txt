Which of the following definitions, if any, are invalid? Why?

a) int ival = 1.01;
b) int &rval1 = 1.01;
c) int &rval2 = ival;
d) int &rval3;

b) & d).
Since the references are not objects, then they do not have any memory address. Which is why
references cannot store literals, as is the case in b).
For the same reason, they must be initialized at the time of declaration,
that is they must refer to another object whenever they are declared. Which is why d) is invalid.
