Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain the differences among the literals
in each of the four examples:

a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC
c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L
d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2

a) The first two are characters, while the second two are strings. In other words, the latter two
   are translated to "\0a". The ones without the L prefix are char, while the ones with the L
   prefix are of type extended char.

b) Whenever we have an int literal it'll take the type of the smallest int type where the literal
   fits. If it fits into an int, it'll be an int, if not, it'll be a long int, and then a long long.
   The first one will try to fit into at least an int, second one into a unsigned int, third into
   a long int and fourth into a unsigned long.

   The fourth and fifth ones are the octal and hexadecimal form of the Form Feed (FF), respectively,
   which is commonly used as page separators.

c) First one is a double, second a float, third a long double.

d) First one is an int, second an unsigned int, third a double and last one also a double.
