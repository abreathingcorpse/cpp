What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short?
Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

If we sat that int has an x amount of bits, short has less memory space reserved,
while long has more and long long is for double precision float types I seem to recall
that a long long has the same minimum amount of bytes as a long.
