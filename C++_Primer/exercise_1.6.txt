Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
	  << " and " << v2;
	  << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not?
How would you fix it?

It's not legal, since we are ending the statement on each of the lines, yet we only called the
standard output once.
We need to either, remove the colons ending the statements on the lines which do not end with std::endl; or, call the std::cout on the all of the last two lines, like the first one does.
