To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment?
Explain why you selected each type.

I had to search a bit, just to try to understand what each of these actually are.
rate.- I understand that this is the interest rate.
principal.- Apparently one can pay either to the interest or to the principal and by paying the
	    latter then one may decrease the debt substantially.
payment.- I guess this is what one still owes?

If the above definitions are correct then I'd simply use double type for all of them,
given that all may require me to count up the cents. Furthermore, the book's guidelines mention that
one should use double above float, given that the pros are higher than the cons.
